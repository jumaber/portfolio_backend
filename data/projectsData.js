      "<p>Mister Spex is one of Europe’s leading online opticians. As a digital-first company, delivering a smooth and cohesive online shopping experience is essential.</p><p>However, the Lens Configuration Page—where customers select and customize their lenses—was outdated. It was weighed down by technical legacy, limiting UX improvements and hindering marketing flexibility. Visually, it no longer aligned with the updated design system used across the rest of the site. In addition, the mobile and desktop versions were built on separate codebases, making updates inefficient and preventing a truly responsive, unified experience.</p><p>I was responsible for the complete redesign of this critical page. It represents the most complex step in the shopping journey—both from UX and development perspectives—and the most decisive moment in the purchase process. My goal was to modernize the UI, unify the experience across devices and touchpoints, and lay the groundwork for improved performance, scalability, and future experimentation.</p>",

      "Happy Cat is a playful arcade game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS using an object-oriented structure. Players choose between two pixel-style cats—Nit or Dia—and guide them to catch fish while avoiding falling bombs. Catch 5 fish to earn a heart. Fill all 5 hearts (50 fish total) to win. But beware: one bomb and it’s game over! The game uses audio feedback, jump and movement animations, level progression with increasing speed, and clean class-based logic to deliver a charming yet challenging experience.",
