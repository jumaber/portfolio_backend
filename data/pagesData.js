    aboutDescription:
      "I'm a Senior Product Experience Designer with a strong track record of driving design consistency, improving user satisfaction, and contributing to business growth. I believe that great product design requires a solid understanding of how things are builtâ€”especially when most resources go into development. This perspective helps me bridge the gap between design and engineering, contributing to solutions that are both thoughtful and scalable. With a background in Fine Arts, entrepreneurial experience as the founder of Artconnect.com, and a career spanning both startups and larger companies, I bring a balance of creativity, structure, and systems thinking to every project.",
