    aboutDescription:
      "I'm a Senior Product Experience Designer with a strong track record of driving design consistency, improving user satisfaction, and contributing to business growth. I believe that great product design requires a solid understanding of how things are built—especially when most resources go into development. This perspective helps me bridge the gap between design and engineering, contributing to solutions that are both thoughtful and scalable. With a background in Fine Arts, entrepreneurial experience as the founder of Artconnect.com, and a career spanning both startups and larger companies, I bring a balance of creativity, structure, and systems thinking to every project.",
